changes:

I made many changes on nearly all parts of the cc65-package but there's
still a lot of work...

Some changes :

1) All source should now compile with gcc on whatever machine (feedback !!).
2) No native stuff anymore.
3) Identifiers max length is now set to 32
4) ra65 is now case-sensitiv
5) *.COM files do have a BLL header (hehehe).
6) cc65's options are case-sensitiv
7) cc65 accepts -D to define macros on command-line
8) start-address for link65 defaults now to $400.

To do :
1) structs do not hide there components.
2) Emulating register with zero-page variables.
97/6/7
Done.
3) local labels in ra65
4) porting BLL to ra65 or vice versa ;-)
5) Compounds do not hide there locals :(
6) Change the hand-coded divide-routine to a Suzy-based one.

PS: Again : don't forget to set CC65LIB and CC65INCLUDE !!!
PPS: Always include global.h or lynx.h !!!!
