    CC65 is a PD C compiler for Atari 8-bit computers.

Using it:

Essentially, all you do to use CC65 is start it up and hand it a file
name to compile on a command line.

Input files are assumed to be C source.  Extension .C is assumed if
not specified.

Include files are first searched in the C-source directory, then in
one defined by the enviroment-variable CC65INCLUDE.

Switches:

	-v	Verbose.  -v once means print function names as
		they're encountered.  Twice prints source lines
		as they're read.

	-d	Debug.  Turns on various debugging code.

        -Dmacro Define a macro

        -s      print storage information (for debugging purpose)

        -h      print hash-table statistics (for debugging purpose)

        -C      include source as comment in the output-file

        -I      specify include-directory

        -?      show help

        -N      copyleft-notice


CC65 processes a source file and produces a file with the same name,
and extension .M65, ie if you compile foo.c, you'll get foo.m65.  The
assembler language produced is suitable for feeding to RA65, although
you could probably get it to work by defining a couple of macros using
something like MAC/65.
