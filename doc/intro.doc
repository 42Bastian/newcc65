			Getting started using CC65.

CC65, XOPT, RA65, LINK65, and LIBR65, along with the assorted runtime
libraries and things, comprise everything you should need to compile
and run C programs on your Atari 8-bit computer.

Basically, the sequence of things you do to compile a and run a C
program is as follows:

1:  Use CC65 to compile your C source into assembler language
2:  Use XOPT to optimize you output-file.
3:  Use RA65 assemble the results into an object file
4:  Use LINK65 to link your object file with the C runtime stuff,
    to produce an executable.

In the CC65 distribution, you should find some demos (examples.c65).
