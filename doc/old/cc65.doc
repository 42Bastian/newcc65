			CC65 preliminary doc

    CC65 is a PD C compiler for Atari 8-bit computers.

Using it:

Essentially, all you do to use CC65 is start it up and hand it a file
name to compile.  This can be done either on a command line, or by
typing it in at the prompt after CC65 starts up.

Input files are assumed to be C source.  Extension .C is assumed if
not specified.

Include files are currently assumed to be on the same drive as the C
source file.  [If anyone can think of a better way to do this, please
tell me]

Switches:

	-v	Verbose.  -v once means print function names as
		they're encountered.  Twice prints source lines
		as they're read.

	-d	Debug.  Turns on various debugging code.


CC65 processes a source file and produces a file with the same name,
and extension .M65, ie if you compile foo.c, you'll get foo.m65.  The
assembler language produced is suitable for feeding to RA65, although
you could probably get it to work by defining a couple of macros using
something like MAC/65.
